    * cases, the current RpcOut channel is not valid anymore, and we'll get an
    * error. The RpcOut lib doesn't really reply with a useful error, but it
    * does have consistent error messages starting with "RpcOut:".
    *
    * So, if the error is one of those messages, restart the RpcOut channel and
    * try to send the message again. If this second attempt fails, then give up.
    *
    * This is not 100% break-proof: a reset can still occur after we open the
    * new channel and before we try to re-send the message. But that's a race
    * that we can't easily fix, and exists even in code that just uses the
    * RpcOut_SendOne() API. Also, if some host handler returns an error that
    * starts with "RpcOut:", it will trigger this; but I don't think we have
